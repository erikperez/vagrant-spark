# vagrant-spark

##Installation

Open console and type ```vagrant up```

Downloads Spark 1.6.0 and builds it (and downloads dependencies as well..)
However, because it builds Spark it takes a while. 
So maybe we should change the template to download ```prebuilt  hadoop 2.6``` instead.


Further descriptions will come.
